colourdistance
==============

My old implementation of colourdistance algorithm with c speedups
Exposes two methods, `colour_distance` and `closest_by_palette`.

`colour_distance` calculates distance between 2 RGB tuples.
`closest_by_palette` finds closest colour from a given palette (tuple of RGB tuples).
